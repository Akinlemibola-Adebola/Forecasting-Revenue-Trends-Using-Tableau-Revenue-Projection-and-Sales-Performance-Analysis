# Forecasting-Revenue-Trends-Using-Tableau-Revenue-Projection-and-Sales-Performance-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing historical sales performance and forecasting future revenue using Tableau’s built-in forecasting feature. The analysis evaluates overall sales, profitability, with the goal of providing data-driven insights that can support strategic planning and decision-making. By leveraging visualization and time-series forecasting, the dashboard presents both past performance and projected revenue for the next two years.

# Objectives
The key objectives of this analysis are to:
- Evaluate overall business performance in terms of sales, profit, and customer engagement.
- Identify top-performing states, products, and sales periods.
- Analyze purchasing behavior across days of the week and product categories.
- Forecast revenue for the next two years to support planning and growth strategies.

# Key Observations

- Overall Performance: The business generated total sales of $2.30M, with $286.4K in profits, indicating a healthy profit margin relative to revenue. A total of 37,873 units were sold to 793 customers, suggesting moderate customer concentration.
- Revenue Growth Trend: Revenue shows a consistent upward trend from 2011 ($484K) to 2014 ($734K). Forecasted revenue continues this growth trajectory, reaching approximately $791K in 2015 and $874K in 2016, reflecting sustained business expansion.
- Regional Performance: California emerged as the best-performing state, contributing the highest sales volume, highlighting its strategic importance to overall revenue generation.
- Daily Sales Behavior: Average daily sales peak on Sundays (254.7), Tuesdays, and Fridays, while Wednesdays (208.49) show the lowest average sales. This indicates stronger customer purchasing activity towards weekends.
- Product Profitability: Copiers are the most profitable product by average profit ($817.91), significantly outperforming other categories. Accessories, phones, and chairs also contribute positively but at much lower margins.
- Product Demand: High-volume products such as Binders (5,974 units) and Paper (5,178 units) dominate by quantity sold, though they are not the most profitable, indicating a classic high-volume, low-margin dynamic.

# Recommendations

- Focus on High-Margin Products: Increase strategic emphasis on high-profit products such as copiers through targeted marketing, bundling, or priority stocking.
- Optimize Sales Timing: Align promotions and campaigns with high-performing days (weekends and early weekdays) to maximize revenue impact.
- Customer Expansion Strategy: With fewer than 1,000 customers generating over $2M in sales, expanding the customer base could significantly boost revenue and reduce dependency on repeat customers.
- Inventory and Pricing Review: Reassess pricing and inventory strategies for high-volume but low-margin products to improve profitability without sacrificing demand.
- Leverage Forecast Insights: Use the revenue forecast to guide budgeting, staffing, and inventory planning for the next two years.
